# Random-Book-Database-Generator
This Python script generates a SQLite database (book.db) containing information about books. Each book entry includes a randomly generated name, number of pages, cover type, and category. The sqlite3 library is used for database operations and the random module for generating random data.

# Features
1. The script generates random names, page counts, cover types, and categories for each book entry.
2. It creates a SQLite database named book.db and defines a table named books to store the book information.
3. It inserts randomly generated book entries into the books table.
4. The script performs several queries on the database, including calculating the average number of pages and finding the name of the book with the most pages.
